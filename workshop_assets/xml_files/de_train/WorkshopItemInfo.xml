  <Name>de_train (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_train, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_train was first added in the CS beta, and has subsequently appeared in every major game since. It has become a fan favourite and one of the most iconic defuse maps. 

Supports Army Battlefield and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
