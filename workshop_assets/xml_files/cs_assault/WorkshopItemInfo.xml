  <Name>cs_assault (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of cs_assault, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

cs_assault was one of the first hostage rescue maps, first appearing in the 2000 beta and subsequently re-appearing in [i]1.6[/i], [i]Condition Zero[/i], [i]Source[/i], and [i]Global Offensive[/i]. Although it has been balanced in later games, it is still very T-sided - but remains a firm fan favourite.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working hostage objectives. To capture a hostage, play as CT and hold 'E' on the objective.
