  <Description>The 1.6 version of awp_india, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

awp_india is an aim map for 1.6 - it was originally designed and released by bobo (Johan Fasting). Its simplicity saw it being replicated across all major Counter-Strike versions.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. Perfect for a lobby map.
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.
