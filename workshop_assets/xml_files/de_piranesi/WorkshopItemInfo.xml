  <Name>de_piranesi (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_piranesi, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_piranesa was first added in 1.6, and has subsequently appeared in every major CS game since except [i]Global Offensive[/i]. It remains one of the most popular and recognisable defusal maps. 

Supports Army Battlefield and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
