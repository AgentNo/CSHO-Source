  <Name>cs_italy (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of cs_italy, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

cs_italy is a hostage rescue map, first appearing in the 2000 beta and subsequently re-appearing in every game since. It remains one of the most popular and iconic hostage rescue maps.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working hostage objectives. To capture a hostage, play as CT and hold 'E' on the objective.
