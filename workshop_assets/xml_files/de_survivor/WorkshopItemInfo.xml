  <Name>de_survivor (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_survivor, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_survivor was first added in CS 1.3, and has subsequently appeared in [i]Condition Zero[/i]. Although somewhat unique because of it's snowy setting, it never returned in future games.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
