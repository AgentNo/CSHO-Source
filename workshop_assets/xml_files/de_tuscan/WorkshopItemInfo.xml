  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_tuscan, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_tuscan was not a vanilla map for 1.6 - it was originally designed and released by Brute as a mod map, and remastered for [i]Source[/i]. 
It was made as a copyright-free version of the existing cp_mill map, and quickly became one of the most popular modded maps.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
