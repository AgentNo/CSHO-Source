  <Name>de_prodigy (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_prodigy, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_prodigy was first added in 1.6, and has appeared in every major CS game since except [i]Global Offensive[/i]. It is considered one of the worst official maps due to it's confusing layout and poor map design, which later games attempted to rectify.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
