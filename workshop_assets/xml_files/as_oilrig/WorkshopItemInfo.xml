  <Name>as_oilrig (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of as_oilrig, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

as_oilrig is the only official map for Assasination, the gamemode where CTs must escort a VIP to an exfil point. It was not a popular gamemode, and did not return for later games.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.
