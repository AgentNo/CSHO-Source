  <Name>cs_backalley (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of cs_backalley, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

cs_backalley was one of the first hostage rescue maps, first appearing in the 2000 beta and subsequently re-appearing in [i]1.6[/i], and [i]Condition Zero[/i]. A remastered version was briefly added to [i]Global Offensive[/i] as part of Operation Vanguard.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working hostage objectives. To capture a hostage, play as CT and hold 'E' on the objective.
