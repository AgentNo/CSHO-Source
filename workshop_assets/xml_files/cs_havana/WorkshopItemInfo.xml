  <Name>cs_havana (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of cs_havana, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

cs_havana was a hostage rescue map, first appearing in the 2000 beta and subsequently re-appearing in [i]1.6[/i], [i]Condition Zero[/i], and [i]Source[/i]. It was one of the few maps that included dynamic elements such as randomly opened and closed doors, making it interesting to play.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working hostage objectives. To capture a hostage, play as CT and hold 'E' on the objective.
