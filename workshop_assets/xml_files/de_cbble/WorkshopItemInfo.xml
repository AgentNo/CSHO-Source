  <Name>de_cbble (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_cbble, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_cbble was one of the first and largest defuse maps, first appearing in the [i]1.6 beta[/i] and subsequently re-appearing in every game since. It has underwent significant redesign in later games, but still remains a firm favourite.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
