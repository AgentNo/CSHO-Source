  <Name>de_airstrip (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_airstrip, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_airstrip was a defuse map, first appearing in [i]1.6[/i] and subsequently re-appearing in [i]Condition Zero[/i]. Although unofficial ports exist for later games, it have never received any official support.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
