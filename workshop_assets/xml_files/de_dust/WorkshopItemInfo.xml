  <Name>de_dust (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_dust, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_dust was one of the first and largest defuse maps, first appearing in the [i]1.6 beta[/i] and subsequently re-appearing in every game since. It was later succeeded by de_dust2, but still remains an iconic map of the series.

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
