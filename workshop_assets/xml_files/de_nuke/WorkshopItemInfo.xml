  <Name>de_nuke (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_nuke, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_nuke was first added in the CS beta, and has appeared in every major CS game since. It remains one of the most popular and recognisable defusal maps in the game, often going through substantial visual makeovers. 

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
