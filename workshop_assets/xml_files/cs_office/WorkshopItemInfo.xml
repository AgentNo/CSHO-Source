  <Name>cs_office (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of cs_office, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

cs_office is of the most iconic hostage rescue map, first appearing in [i]1.6[/i] and re-appearing in every game since. It has underwent major graphical and gameplay overhauls, but still remains a popular map.

Supports Army Battlefield and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working hostage objectives. To capture a hostage, play as CT and hold 'E' on the objective.
