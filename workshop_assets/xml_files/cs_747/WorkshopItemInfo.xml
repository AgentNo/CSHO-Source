  <Name>cs_747 (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of cs_747, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

cs_747 was one of the first hostage rescue maps, first appearing in the 2000 beta and subsequently re-appearing in [i]1.6[/i] and [i]Condition Zero[/i]. Although unofficial ports exist for later games, it have never received an official port.

Supports Army Battlefield and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working hostage objectives. To capture a hostage, play as CT and hold 'E' on the objective.
