  <Name>de_dust2 (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_dust2, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_dust2 - probably the most iconic FPS map ever. Do I really need to introduce this one?

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
