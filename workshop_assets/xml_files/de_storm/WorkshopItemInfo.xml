  <Name>de_storm (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_storm, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_storm was first added in 1.3, and has only reappeared in [i]Condition Zero[/i]. Although a second version was created to fix many of the gameplay issues, it was never made official. 

Supports Army Battlefield, Army Assault, and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
