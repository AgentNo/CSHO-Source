  <Name>de_mirage (1.6)</Name>
  <Description>The 1.6 version of de_mirage, ported to [i]Holdfast: Nations at War[/i]!

de_mirage was not a vanilla map for 1.6 - it was originally designed and released by BubkeZ as a mod map, and remastered for [i]Source[/i]. It was finally added as an official map in [i]Global Offensive[/i], becoming one of the most recognisable, most played, and iconic maps of the series.

Supports Army Battlefield and Melee Arena. This map is best suited to smaller populations, the recommended configs available in this repository: https://github.com/AgentNo/holdfast-server-configs .
Sappers will be unable to build on this map due to the lack of terrain.

This map also features working bombsite objectives. To plant a bomb, play as T and hold 'E' on either objective.
