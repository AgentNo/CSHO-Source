# Holdfast CS 1.6 Maps - Source files
Source files for all my CS 1.6 maps ported to Holdfast: Nations at War. Can be opened and edited in the Holdfast: Nations at War SDK.

My original workshop versions can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2438605434

You are free to use these files as you see fit, and to upload modded versions to the Steam Workshop and/or Holdfast Official Discord as long as credit is provided.
